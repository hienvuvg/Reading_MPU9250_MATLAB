# Fixing wrong orientation of HelperOrientationViewer

Fixing wrong orientation of HelperOrientationViewer for Sensor Fusion and Tracking Toolbox on MATLAB.

readSensorDataMPU9250v2.m is the corrected function, please download and put the .m file to the following folder:

C:\...\Documents\MATLAB\Examples\R2019a\arduinoio\EstimatingOrientationUsingInertialSensorFusionAndMPU9250Example

Please pay attention to your MATLAB version, here I'm using R2019a. If you use a different version, please change the path accordingly. Remember to modify your original function by adding "v2" at the end to mach with this function.
